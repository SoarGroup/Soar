# This is a sample configuration for the test_svs program. test_svs is intended
# to be a kind of unit test framework for verifying the correctness of filter
# implementations. It allows the user to easily set up a scene in SVS and check
# if filters applied to that scene will generate the expected results.
#
# This file has a line-oriented syntax. Each line can be one of the following:
#
# * An SGEL command 
# * A test specification 
# * One of the following single words: init, test, repl
#
# Run test_svs as follows:
#
# ./test_svs <test config>
#
# test_svs creates a Soar agent and then reads each line in the configuration
# sequentially.  If the line is an SGEL command, it is sent to the SVS of the
# test agent. 
#
# If the line is a test specification, it is translated into a production that
# puts an extract command on the SVS link. 
#
# If the line is "init", the agent is reinitialized and all existing
# productions are excised. This also means that the SVS scene is cleared.
#
# If the line is "test", the agent runs for two decision cycles. This allows it
# to process all queued SGEL inputs and extract commands. Special productions
# in the agent will check the result of each extract command and report it to
# stdout as either success, failure, or syntax error. Existing test productions
# are then excised, but the agent is not reinitialized. Note that if the end of
# the file is reached and there are untested productions, an implicit test is
# executed.
#
# If the line is "repl", test_svs will enter a simple command line interface
# similar to TestCLI so that the user can inspect productions and working
# memory. Exit the REPL by sending Ctrl-D. test_svs will then continue
# processing the rest of the configuration file.
#
# Test specifications have the following syntax:
#
# want <value test> <param test> <filter name> <arg name> <arg value> ...
#
# <value test> specifies the expected outcome of the filter. <param test>
# specifies the expected parameter set chosen by the filter, for use with
# many-to-one filters such as "closest". It should have the form
#
#   (<arg name> <arg value> ...)
#
# The parentheses are required. Either test can be "*" for don't care.
#
# <arg value> is either: A node name, a numeric or string constant, or a
# recursive filter specification.  Constants have to begin with "c:" so that
# they can be distinguished from node names. Recursive filters are surrounded
# by parentheses, as in 
#
#   "(<filter name> <arg name> <arg value> ...)"
#
# This file can contain comments prepended with '#'. Long lines can be
# continued by ending the line with a backslash (\).
