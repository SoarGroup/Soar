/* Defining SOAR_RELEASE_VERSION will:
 *
 * 1 -  Remove debug trace statements
 * 2 -  Soar will not re-direct all printing output from callbacks to cout
 *         (useful for debugging, keeps things in the right order)
 * 3 -  Memory pools and memory pool allocators will be turned on (if disabled below)
 * 4 -  Debugging flags below will be disabled
 *
 * Note:  The default build is optimized, so NDEBUG will be true, which will automatically
 *        make SOAR_RELEASE_VERSION also true.
 *
 *        (use --dbg for debug build)
 *
 * Note:  Debug printing will prevent Soar from sending output to the SoarJavaDebugger.
