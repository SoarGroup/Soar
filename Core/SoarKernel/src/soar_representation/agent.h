    /* ----------------------- Timing statistics -------------------------- */

    /*
    When the compile flag NO_TIMING_STUFF is off, statistics will be collected on
    total cpu time, total kernel time, time spent in the individual phases of a
    decision cycle, time spent executing the input and output functions, and time
    spent executing callbacks (or monitors).  When the DETAILED_TIMING_STATS flag
    is set, additional statistics will be collected for ownership, match, and
    chunking computations according to the phase in which they occur. (Notice
    that DETAILED_TIMING_STATS can only be collected when NO_TIMING_STUFF is not
    true.)

    The total_cpu_time is turned on when one of the run_<x> functions is
    initiated.  This timer is not turned off while the do_one_top_level_phase()
    function is executing.  The total_kernel_time timer is turned on just after
    the total_cpu_time timer and turned off just before the other is turned off.
    This guarantees that the total kernel time -- including the time it takes to
    turn on and off the kernel timer -- is a part of the total cpu time.  The
    total_kernel_time is also turned off whenever a callback is initiated or when
    the input and output functions are executing.

    The decision_cycle_phase_timers measure the kernel time for each phase of the
    decision cycle (ie, INPUT_PHASE, PREFERENCE_PHASE, WM_PHASE, OUTPUT_PHASE,
    and DECISION_PHASE).  Each is turned on at the beginning of its corresponding
    phase in do_one_top_level_phase and turned off at the end of that phase.
    These timers are also turned off for callbacks and during the execution of
    the input and output functions.

    The monitors_cpu_time timers are also indexed by the current phase.  Whenever
    a callback is initiated, both the total_kernel_time and
    decision_cycle_phase_timer for the current phase are turned off and the
    monitors_cpu_time turned on.  After the callback has terminated, the kernel
    timers are turned back on.  Notice that the same relationship holds here as
    it did between the total_cpu_time and total_kernel_time timers.  The
    total_kernel_time is always turned off last and turned on first, in
    comparison to the decision_cycle_phase_timer.  This means that turning the
    decision_cycle_phase_timers on and off is included as part of the kernel time
    and helps ensure that the total_kernel_time is always greater than the sum of
    the decision_cycle_timers.

    The input_function_cpu_time and output_function_cpu_time timers measure the
    time it takes to execute the input and output functions respectively.  Both
    the total_kernel_time and decision_cycle_phase_timers are turned off when
    these timers are turned on (with the same ordering as discussed previously).
    The input function is a little tricky.  Because add-wme can be called by the
    input routine, which then calls do_buffered_wm_and_ownership_changes, we
    can't just turn off the kernel timers for input and expect to get numbers for
    both match_time (see next para) and kernel time.  The solution implemented in
    the 28.07.96 changes is to not turn off the kernel timers until the actual
    INPUT_PHASE_CALLBACK is initiated.  This takes care of all but direct
    additions and removals of WMEs.  Since these are done through the add-wme and
    remove-wme commands, the input_timer is turned off there was well, and the
    kernel timers turned back on (for the buffered wm changes).  However, this is
    a hack and may introduce problems when add-wme and remove-wme are used at the
    command line or someplace in the decision cycle other than input (probably
    rare but possible).

    The DETAILED_TIMING_STATS flag enables collection of statistics on match,
    ownership and chunking calculations performed in each part of the decision
    cycle.  An 'other' value is reported which is simply the difference between
    the sum of the deailed timers and the kernel timer for some pahse.  The other
    value should always be greater than or equal to zero.

    The "stats" command (in soarCommandUtils) has been updated to report these
    new timing values.  The output is provided in a spreadsheet-style format to
    display the information in a succinct form.  There are also some derived
    totals in that report.  The derived totals in the right column are simply the
    sum of the all the other columns in a particular row; for example, the
    derived total for the first row, kernel time, is just the sum of all the
    decision_cycle_phase_timers.  The derived totals in the bottom row are the
    sum of all the basic timers in that row (i.e., no DETAILED statistics are
    included in the sum).  For example, the derived total under input is equal to
    the sum of decision_cycle_phase_timer and the monitors_time for the
    INPUT_PHASE, and the input_function_cpu_time and represents the total time
    spent in the input phase for the current run.  The number in the lower
    right-hand corner is the sum of the derived totals above it in that right
    column (and should always be equal to the numbers to the left of it in that
    row).

    Also reported with the stats command are the values of total_cpu_time and
    total_kernel_time.  If the ordering discussed above is strictly enforced,
    total_kernel_time should always be slightly greater than the derived total
    kernel time and total_cpu_time greater than the derived total CPU time. REW */
