                                      Name

   load-library - Load a shared library into the local client (for the
   purpose of, e.g., providing custom event handling).

                                    Synopsis

 load-library [library_name] [arguments]

   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

                                  Description

   Sometimes, a user will want to extend an existing environment. For
   example, the person may want to provide custom RHS functions, or register
   for print events for the purpose of logging trace information. If
   modifying the existing environment is cumbersome or impossible, then the
   user has two options: create a remote client that provides the
   functionality, or use load-library. Load-library creates extensions in the
   local client, making it orders of magnitude faster than a remote client.

   To create a loadable library, the library must contain the following
   function:

 #ifdef __cplusplus
 extern "C" {
 #endif

 EXPORT char* sml_InitLibrary(Kernel* pKernel, int argc, char** argv) {
   // Your code here
 }

 #ifdef __cplusplus
 } // extern "C"
 #endif

   This function is called when load-library loads your library. It is
   responsible for any initialization that you want to take place (e.g.
   registering custom RHS functions, registering for events, etc).

   The argc and argv arguments are intended to mirror the arguments that a
   standard SML client would get. Thus, the first argument is the name of the
   library, and the rest are whatever other arguments are provided. This is
   to make it easy to use the same codebase to create a loadable library or a
   standard remote SML client (e.g. when run as a standard client, just pass
   the arguments main gets into sml_InitLibrary).

   The return value of sml_InitLibrary is for any error messages you want to
   return to the load-library call. If no error occurs, return a zero-length
   string.

   An example library is provided in the Tools/TestExternalLibraryLib
   project. This example can also be compiled as a standard remote SML
   client. The Tools/TestExternalLibraryExe project tests loading the
   TestExternalLibraryLib library.

                                    Examples

   To load TestExternalLibraryLib:

 load-library TestExternalLibraryLib

   To load a library that takes arguments (say, a logger):

 load-library my-logger -filename mylog.log
