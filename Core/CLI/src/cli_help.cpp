		"The chunk command controls the parameters for explanation-based chunking. With\n"
		"no arguments, this command prints out a basic summary of the current learning\n"
		"parameters, how many rules have been learned and which states have learning\n"
		"active. With an ? argument, it will list all sub-commands, options and their\n"
		"current values.\n"
		"\n"
		"Turning on Explanation-Based Chunking\n"
		"\n"
		"Chunking is disabled by default. Learning can be turned on or off at any point\n"
		"during a run. Also note that Soar uses most aspects of EBC to create\n"
		"justifications as well, so many aspects of the chunking algorithm still occur\n"
		"even when learning is off.\n"
		"\n"
		"  chunk always:      Soar will always attempt to learn rules from sub-state\n"
		"                     problem-solving.\n"
		"  chunk never:       Soar will never attempt to learn rules.\n"
		"  chunk unflagged:   Chunking is on in all states _except_ those that have had\n"
		"  RHS\n"
		"                     `dont-learn` actions executed in them.\n"
		"  chunk flagged:     Chunking is off for all states except those that are\n"
		"  flagged\n"
		"                     via a RHS `force-learn` actions.\n"
		"\n"
		"The flagged argument and its companion force-learn RHS action allow Soar\n"
		"developers to turn learning on in a particular problem space, so that they can\n"
		"focus on debugging the learning problems in that particular problem space\n"
		"without having to address the problems elsewhere in their programs at the same\n"
		"time. Similarly, the unflagged flag and its companion dont-learn RHS action\n"
		"allow developers to temporarily turn learning off for debugging purposes. These\n"
		"facilities are provided as debugging tools, and do not correspond to any theory\n"
		"of learning in Soar.\n"
		"The bottom-only setting control when chunks are formed when there are multiple\n"
		"levels of subgoals. With bottom-up learning, chunks are learned only in states\n"
		"in which no subgoal has yet generated a chunk. In this mode, chunks are learned\n"
		"only for the \"bottom\" of the subgoal hierarchy and not the intermediate levels.\n"
		"With experience, the subgoals at the bottom will be replaced by the chunks,\n"
		"allowing higher level subgoals to be chunked.\n"
		"\n"
		"Debugging Explanation-Based Chunking\n"
		"\n"
		"The best way to understand why and how rules formed is to use the explain\n"
		"command. It will create detailed snapshots of everything that existed when a\n"
		"rule or justification formed that you can interactively explore. See explain\n"
		"for more information. You can even use it in conjunction with the visualizer to\n"
		"create graphs depicting the dependency between rules in a sub-state.\n"
		"The stats command will print a detailed table containing statistics about all\n"
		"chunking activity during that run.\n"
		"The interrupt setting forces Soar to stop after forming any rule.\n"
		"The explain-interrupt setting forces Soar to stop when it attempts to form a\n"
		"rule from a production that is being watched by the explainer. See explain for\n"
		"more information.\n"
		"The warning interrupts setting forces Soar to stop when it attempts to form a\n"
		"rule but detects an issue that may be problematic.\n"
		"The record-utility command is a tool to determine how much processing may be\n"
		"saved by a particular learned rule. When enabled, Soar will detect that a chunk\n"
		"matched, but will not fire it. Assuming that the rule is correct, this should\n"
		"lead to an impasse that causes a duplicate chunk to form. The amount of time\n"
		"and decision cycles spent in that impasse are recorded and stored for the rule.\n"

		"Chunking through local negations can result in overgeneral chunks, but\n"
		"disabling this ability will reduce the number of chunks formed. The default is\n"
		"to enable chunking through local negations.\n"

		"chunks, and Soar will proceed to the next phase. A warning message is printed\n"
		"to notify the user that the limit has been reached.\n"

		"Characters can also be escaped with a backslash (so string literals with\n"

		"gp is primarily intended as an alternative to :template rules for reinforcement\n"
		"learning. :template rules generate new rules as patterns occur at run time.\n"
		"Unfortunately, this incurs a high run time cost. If all possible values are\n"

		"allowing code to run faster. gp is not appropriate when all possible values are\n"

		"possible to combine gp and :template (e.g., if some of the values are known and\n"

		"memory usage for all productions. If a production_name is specified, memory\n"

		"given, only number productions will be printed: the number productions that use\n"

		"types of productions using the command options.\n"
		"Memory usage is recorded according to the tokens that are allocated in the Rete\n"

		"most memory and, therefore, may be taking the longest time to match (this is\n"
		"only a heuristic). By identifying these productions, you may be able to rewrite\n"
		"your program so that it will run more quickly. Note that memory usage is just a\n"

		"relative to others but may still be time-consuming to match, and excising a\n"
		"production that uses a large number of tokens may not speed up your program,\n"

		"Description\n"
		"\n"
		"The run command starts the Soar execution cycle or continues any execution that\n"
		"was temporarily stopped. The default behavior of run, with no arguments, is to\n"
		"cause Soar to execute until it is halted or interrupted by an action of a\n"
		"production, or until an external interrupt is issued by the user. The run\n"
		"command can also specify that Soar should run only for a specific number of\n"
		"Soar cycles or phases (which may also be prematurely stopped by a production\n"
		"action or the stop-soar command). This is helpful for debugging sessions, where\n"
		"users may want to pay careful attention to the specific productions that are\n"
		"firing and retracting.\n"
		"The run command takes optional arguments: an integer, count, which specifies\n"
		"how many units to run; and a units flag indicating what steps or increments to\n"
		"use. If count is specified, but no units are specified, then Soar is run by\n"
		"decision cycles. If units are specified, but count is unpecified, then count\n"
		"defaults to '1'. If both are unspecified, Soar will run until either a halt is\n"
		"executed, an interrupt is received, or max stack depth is reached.\n"
		"If there are multiple Soar agents that exist in the same Soar process, then\n"
		"issuing a run command in any agent will cause all agents to run with the same\n"
		"set of parameters, unless the flag --self is specified, in which case only that\n"
		"agent will execute.\n"
		"If an environment is registered for the kernel's update event, then when the\n"
		"event it triggered, the environment will get information about how the run was\n"
		"executed. If a run was executed with the --update option, then then event sends\n"
		"a flag requesting that the environment actually update itself. If a run was\n"
		"executed with the --noupdate option, then the event sends a flag requesting\n"
		"that the environment not update itself. The --update option is the default when\n"
		"run is specified without the --self option is not specified. If the --self\n"
		"option is specified, then the --noupdate option is on by default. It is up to\n"
		"the environment to check for these flags and honor them.\n"
		"Some use cases include:\n"
		"\n"
		"Option              Description\n"
		"run --self          runs one agent but not the environment\n"
		"run --self --update runs one agent and the environment\n"
		"run                 runs all agents and the environment\n"
		"run --noupdate      runs all agents but not the environment\n"
		"\n"
		"Setting an interleave size\n"
		"\n"
		"When there are multiple agents running within the same process, it may be\n"
		"useful to keep agents more closely aligned in their execution cycle than the\n"
		"run increment (--elaboration, --phases, --decisions, --output) specifies. For\n"
		"instance, it may be necessary to keep agents in \"lock step\" at the phase level,\n"
		"even though the run command issued is for 5 decisions. Some use cases include:\n"
		"\n"
		"Option        Description\n"
		"run -d 5 -i p run the agent one phase and then move to the next agent, looping\n"
		"              over agents until they have run for 5 decision cycles\n"
		"              run the agent one decision cycle and then move to the next agent.\n"
		"run -o 3 -i d When an agent generates output for the 3rd time, it no longer\n"
		"              runs even if other agents continue.\n"
		"\n"
		"The interleave parameter must always be equal to or smaller than the specified\n"
		"run parameter.\n"
		"\n"

		"With the --system flag, the stats command lists a summary of run statistics,\n"
		"including the following:\n"

		"* Version --- The Soar version number, hostname, and date of the run.\n"
		"* Number of productions --- The total number of productions loaded in the\n"
		"  system, including all chunks built during problem solving and all default\n"
		"  productions.\n"
		"* Timing Information --- Might be quite detailed depending on the flags set at\n"
		"  compile time. See note on timers below.\n"
		"* Decision Cycles --- The total number of decision cycles in the run and the\n"
		"  average time-per-decision-cycle in milliseconds.\n"
		"* Elaboration cycles --- The total number of elaboration cycles that were\n"
		"  executed during the run, the average number of elaboration cycles per\n"
		"  decision cycle, and the average time-per-elaboration-cycle in milliseconds.\n"
		"  This is not the total number of production firings, as productions can fire\n"
		"  in parallel.\n"
		"* Production Firings --- The total number of productions that were fired.\n"
		"* Working Memory Changes --- This is the total number of changes to working\n"
		"  memory. This includes all additions and deletions from working memory. Also\n"
		"  prints the average match time.\n"
		"* Working Memory Size --- This gives the current, mean and maximum number of\n"
		"  working memory elements.\n"
		"\n"
		"The stats argument --memory provides information about memory usage and Soar's\n"
		"memory pools, which are used to allocate space for the various data structures\n"
		"used in Soar.\n"
		"The stats argument --learning provides information about rules learned through\n"
		"Soar's explanation-based chunking mechanism. This is the same output that chunk\n"
		"stats provides. For statistics about a specific rule learned, see the explain\n"
		"command.\n"
		"The stats argument --rete provides information about node usage in the Rete\n"
		"net, the large data structure used for efficient matching in Soar.\n"
		"The --max argument reports per-cycle maximum statistics for decision cycle\n"
		"time, working memory changes, and production fires. For example, if Soar runs\n"
		"for three cycles and there were 23 working memory changes in the first cycle,\n"
		"42 in the second, and 15 in the third, the --max argument would report the\n"
		"highest of these values (42) and what decision cycle that it occurred in (2nd).\n"
		"Statistics about the time spent executing the decision cycle and number of\n"
		"productions fired are also collected and reported by --max in this manner. --\n"
		"reset zeros out these statistics so that new maximums can be recorded for\n"
		"future runs. The numbers are also zeroed out with a call to init-soar.\n"
		"The --track argument starts tracking the same stats as the --max argument but\n"
		"records all data for each cycle instead of the maximum values. This data can be\n"
		"printed using the --cycle or --cycle-csv arguments. When printing the data with\n"
		"--cycle, it may be sorted using the --sort argument and a column integer. Use\n"
		"negative numbers for descending sort. Issue --stop-track to reset and clear\n"

		"\n"
		"A Note on Timers\n"
		"\n"
		"The current implementation of Soar uses a number of timers to provide time-\n"
		"based statistics for use in the stats command calculations. These timers are:\n"
		"\n"
		"* total CPU time\n"
		"* total kernel time\n"
		"* phase kernel time (per phase)\n"
		"* phase callbacks time (per phase)\n"
		"* input function time\n"
		"* output function time\n"
		"\n"
		"Total CPU time is calculated from the time a decision cycle (or number of\n"
		"decision cycles) is initiated until stopped. Kernel time is the time spent in\n"
		"core Soar functions. In this case, kernel time is defined as the all functions\n"
		"other than the execution of callbacks and the input and output functions. The\n"
		"total kernel timer is only stopped for these functions. The phase timers (for\n"
		"the kernel and callbacks) track the execution time for individual phases of the\n"
		"decision cycle (i.e., input phase, preference phase, working memory phase,\n"
		"output phase, and decision phase). Because there is overhead associated with\n"
		"turning these timers on and off, the actual kernel time will always be greater\n"
		"than the derived kernel time (i.e., the sum of all the phase kernel timers).\n"
		"Similarly, the total CPU time will always be greater than the derived total\n"
		"(the sum of the other timers) because the overhead of turning these timers on\n"
		"and off is included in the total CPU time. In general, the times reported by\n"
		"the single timers should always be greater than than the corresponding derived\n"
		"time. Additionally, as execution time increases, the difference between these\n"
		"two values will also increase. For those concerned about the performance cost\n"
		"of the timers, all the run time timing calculations can be compiled out of the\n"
		"code by defining NO_TIMING_STUFF (in kernel.h) before compilation.\n"

		"which is less than the level to be turned off. For instance, to turn off\n"

		"provided for shorthand convenience. For more detailed control over the trace\n"
		"settings, the named arguments should be used.\n"
		"With no arguments, this command prints information about the current trace\n"
		"status, i.e., the values of each parameter.\n"
		"For the named arguments, including the named argument turns on only that\n"

		"When activation is enabled, the system produces a cache of results of calls to\n"
		"the pow function, as these can be expensive during runtime. The size of the\n"
		"cache is based upon three run-time parameters (decay-rate, decay-thresh, and\n"
		"max-pow-cache), and one compile time parameter, WMA_REFERENCES_PER_DECISION\n"
		"(default value of 50), which estimates the maximum number of times a WME will\n"
		"be referenced during a decision. The cache is composed of double variables\n"
		"(i.e. 64-bits, currently) and the number of cache items is computed as follows:\n"
		"e^((decay_thresh - ln(max_refs)) / decay_rate)\n"
		"With the current default parameter values, this will incur about 1.04MB of\n"
		"memory. Holding the decay-rate constant, reasonable changes to decay-thresh\n"
		"(i.e. +/- 5) does not greatly change this value. However, small changes to\n"
		"decay-rate will dramatically change this profile. For instance, keeping\n"
		"everything else constant, a decay-thresh of 0.3 requires ~2.7GB and 0.2\n"
		"requires ~50TB. Thus, the max-pow-cache parameter serves to allow you to\n"
		"control the space vs. time tradeoff by capping the maximum amount of memory\n"
		"used by this cache. If max-pow-cache is much smaller than the result of the\n"
		"equation above, you may experience somewhat degraded performance due to\n"
		"relatively frequent system calls to pow.\n"
		"If forget-wme is lti and forgetting is on, only those WMEs whose id is a long-\n"
		"term identifier at the decision of forgetting will be removed from working\n"
		"memory. If, for instance, the id is stored to semantic memory after the\n"

		"Timers\n"
		"\n"
		"Working memory activation also has a set of internal timers that record the\n"

		"costs, working memory activation timers are off by default. Timers of different\n"
		"levels of detail can be turned on by issuing wm activation --set timers\n"
		"<level>, where the levels can be off or one, one being most detailed and\n"
		"resulting in all timers being turned on. Note that none of the working memory\n"
		"activation statistics nor timing information is reported by the stats command.\n"
