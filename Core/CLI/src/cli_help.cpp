		"gp is primarily intended as an alternative to :template rules for reinforcement\n"

		"Unfortunately, this incurs a high run time cost. If all possible values are\n"
		"known in advance, then the rules can be generated using gp at source time, thus\n"
		"allowing code to run faster. gp is not appropriate when all possible values are\n"
		"not known or if the total number of possible rules is very large (and the\n"
		"system is likely to encounter only a small subset at run time). It is also\n"
		"possible to combine gp and :template (e.g., if some of the values are known and\n"
		"not others). This should reduce the run time cost of :template.\n"

		"command can also specify that Soar should run only for a specific number of\n"
		"Soar cycles or phases (which may also be prematurely stopped by a production\n"
		"action or the stop-soar command). This is helpful for debugging sessions, where\n"
		"users may want to pay careful attention to the specific productions that are\n"
		"firing and retracting.\n"
		"\n"
		"The run command takes optional arguments: an integer, count, which specifies\n"
		"how many units to run; and a units flag indicating what steps or increments to\n"
		"use. If count is specified, but no units are specified, then Soar is run by\n"
		"decision cycles. If units are specified, but count is unpecified, then count\n"
		"defaults to '1'. If both are unspecified, Soar will run until either a halt is\n"
		"executed, an interrupt is received, or max stack depth is reached.\n"
		"\n"
		"If there are multiple Soar agents that exist in the same Soar process, then\n"
		"issuing a run command in any agent will cause all agents to run with the same\n"
		"set of parameters, unless the flag --self is specified, in which case only that\n"
		"agent will execute.\n"
		"\n"
		"If an environment is registered for the kernel's update event, then when the\n"
		"event it triggered, the environment will get information about how the run was\n"
		"executed. If a run was executed with the --update option, then then event sends\n"
		"a flag requesting that the environment actually update itself. If a run was\n"
		"executed with the --noupdate option, then the event sends a flag requesting\n"
		"that the environment not update itself. The --update option is the default when\n"
		"run is specified without the --self option is not specified. If the --self\n"

		"Description \n"
		"\n"
		"This command prints Soar internal statistics. The argument indicates the\n"
		"component of interest, --system is used by default.\n"
		"\n"
		"With the --system flag, the stats command lists a summary of run statistics,\n"
		"including the following:\n"
		"\n"
		"  * Version --- The Soar version number, hostname, and date of the run.\n"
		"  * Number of productions --- The total number of productions loaded in the\n"
		"    system, including all chunks built during problem solving and all default\n"
		"    productions.\n"
		"  * Timing Information --- Might be quite detailed depending on the flags set\n"
		"    at compile time. See note on timers below.\n"
		"  * Decision Cycles --- The total number of decision cycles in the run and the\n"
		"    average time-per-decision-cycle in milliseconds.\n"
		"  * Elaboration cycles --- The total number of elaboration cycles that were\n"
		"    executed during the run, the average number of elaboration cycles per\n"
		"    decision cycle, and the average time-per-elaboration-cycle in milliseconds.\n"
		"    This is not the total number of production firings, as productions can fire\n"
		"    in parallel.\n"
		"  * Production Firings --- The total number of productions that were fired.\n"
		"  * Working Memory Changes --- This is the total number of changes to working\n"
		"    memory. This includes all additions and deletions from working memory. Also\n"
		"    prints the average match time.\n"
		"  * Working Memory Size --- This gives the current, mean and maximum number of\n"
		"    working memory elements.\n"
		"\n"
		"The stats argument --memory provides information about memory usage and Soar's\n"
		"memory pools, which are used to allocate space for the various data structures\n"
		"used in Soar.\n"
		"\n"
		"The stats argument --rete provides information about node usage in the Rete\n"
		"net, the large data structure used for efficient matching in Soar.\n"
		"\n"
		"The --max argument reports per-cycle maximum statistics for decision cycle\n"
		"time, working memory changes, and production fires. For example, if Soar runs\n"
		"for three cycles and there were 23 working memory changes in the first cycle,\n"
		"42 in the second, and 15 in the third, the --max argument would report the\n"
		"highest of these values (42) and what decision cycle that it occurred in (2nd).\n"
		"Statistics about the time spent executing the decision cycle and number of\n"
		"productions fired are also collected and reported by --max in this manner.\n"
		"--reset zeros out these statistics so that new maximums can be recorded for\n"
		"future runs. The numbers are also zeroed out with a call to init-soar.\n"
		"\n"
		"The --track argument starts tracking the same stats as the --max argument but\n"
		"records all data for each cycle instead of the maximum values. This data can be\n"
		"printed using the --cycle or --cycle-csv arguments. When printing the data with\n"
		"--cycle, it may be sorted using the --sort argument and a column integer. Use\n"
		"negative numbers for descending sort. Issue --stop-track to reset and clear\n"
		"this data.\n"
		"\n"
		"A Note on Timers \n"
		"\n"
		"The current implementation of Soar uses a number of timers to provide\n"
		"time-based statistics for use in the stats command calculations. These timers\n"
		"are:\n"
		"\n"
		"  * total CPU time\n"
		"  * total kernel time\n"
		"  * phase kernel time (per phase)\n"
		"  * phase callbacks time (per phase)\n"
		"  * input function time\n"
		"  * output function time\n"
		"\n"
		"Total CPU time is calculated from the time a decision cycle (or number of\n"
		"decision cycles) is initiated until stopped. Kernel time is the time spent in\n"
		"core Soar functions. In this case, kernel time is defined as the all functions\n"
		"other than the execution of callbacks and the input and output functions. The\n"
		"total kernel timer is only stopped for these functions. The phase timers (for\n"
		"the kernel and callbacks) track the execution time for individual phases of the\n"
		"decision cycle (i.e., input phase, preference phase, working memory phase,\n"
		"output phase, and decision phase). Because there is overhead associated with\n"
		"turning these timers on and off, the actual kernel time will always be greater\n"
		"than the derived kernel time (i.e., the sum of all the phase kernel timers).\n"
		"Similarly, the total CPU time will always be greater than the derived total\n"
		"(the sum of the other timers) because the overhead of turning these timers on\n"
		"and off is included in the total CPU time. In general, the times reported by\n"
		"the single timers should always be greater than than the corresponding derived\n"
		"time. Additionally, as execution time increases, the difference between these\n"
		"two values will also increase. For those concerned about the performance cost\n"
		"of the timers, all the run time timing calculations can be compiled out of the\n"
		"code by defining NO_TIMING_STUFF (in soarkernel.h) before compilation.\n"
