The Obscure-bot is a pretty good bot that uses mapping. This is a good bot to 
test your own bot against. To avoid competitors using its code or reverse 
engineering it, the productions have been saved in a binary form and many of the 
original names have been replaced by obscure symbols.  

To use the Obscure-bot, load in file obscure-bot through the tank-soar control 
panel. This in turn loads in the binary file obscure-bot.soarx. 

Alternatively, you can create a tank using some other Soar project, excise –all 
of the rules, and then use production load (off the file menu) to directly load 
in obscure-bot.soarx.
