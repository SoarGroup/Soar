/************************************************************************
 *
 * Executing Soar commands can take a long time (e.g. "run 1000").
 *
 * If we execute them in the main UI thread then the UI will be locked until
 * Soar returns control to us (menus can't be selected etc.).
 *
 * One solution to this is to execute the Soar commands in a separate thread
 * within the debugger. This class does just that, queueing up commands and
 * executing them.
