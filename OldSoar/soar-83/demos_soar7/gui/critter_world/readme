This directory contains the code for the Critter World demo.  This
demo shows several (3) agents moving around in a Rogue-like map world.

This demo illustrates:

  - definition and control of multiple agents
  - inter-agent communication via Tcl procedures
  - embedding of Tcl data in Soar productions
  - simple, reactive Soar agents
  - a simple Tcl simulator to arbitrate agent actions in the world
  - use of add-wme to communicate input data to Soar agents
  - use of Tcl to communicate Soar actions to simulator
  - file input to initialize map of world
  - use of a random number generator
  - no C coding needed to setup multi-agent interaction
  - separate windows for each agent

To run this demo, invoke "soartk", move to this directory and 
"source critter_world.tcl"
