NAME
     warnings - Enable/Disable Soar warnings

SYNOPSIS
     set warnings [on | off]
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
     warnings is a Soar variable which through the Tcl  _s_e_t  com-
     mand, enables and disables the printing of warning messages.
     If an enabling or disabling _s_t_a_t_u_s of on or  off  is  given,
     then  the  warnings  are set to that state.  If no _s_t_a_t_u_s is
     given, then the current  warnings  status  is  printed.   At
     startup,  warnings  are  initially enabled.  If warnings are
     disabled  using  this  command,  then  _m_o_s_t   warnings   are
     supressed since some are considered too important to ignore.
