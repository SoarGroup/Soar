This directory contains the code for the graph tool demo.
This demo shows the use of an external tool to graph Soar
data.  Soar is run on a problem, data is extracted during the
run and sent to the graphing tool.  This demo illustrates:

  - Ousterhout's hypertool idea
  - creating a subprocess
  - asynchronous interprocess communication using Tk's "send"
    and "after" commands
  - use of an independent tool
  - extraction of statistics using the new Soar "stats" command
  - using Soar callbacks
  - attachment of scripts to Soar events using the "monitor" 
    command
  - use of a monitor to extract statisical information and send
    to the graphing tool
  - use of a monitor to keep the GUI active
  - connecting an application to a simple GUI interface
  - using Tcl procedures to break up script processing
  - use of gateway to previous Soar parser ("soar" command)

To run this demo, invoke "soartk -useIPC", move to this directory and
"source graph_tool.tcl"
