NAME
     production-find - Find matching Soar productions

SYNOPSIS
     production-find [-lhs | -rhs]  [-show-bindings]  [-chunks  |
     -no-chunks] {_p_a_t_t_e_r_n}
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
     The production-find command is used to find Soar productions
     by  matching  a  given  _p_a_t_t_e_r_n  against the production com-
     ponents.  Productions may be found that  test  a  particular
     left-hand side pattern or produce particular right-hand side
     preferences.  For convenience, the  production-find  command
     has the predefined alias pf.


OPTIONS
     If given, an option must match one of the following choices:

     -lhs The following _p_a_t_t_e_r_n applies to the left-hand side  of
          productions.  This is the default.

     -rhs The following _p_a_t_t_e_r_n applies to the right-hand side of
          productions.

     -show-bindings
          Show the bindings associated with  the  following  _p_a_t_-
          _t_e_r_n.

     -chunks
          Search only for chunks (learned productions) that match
          the following _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.

     -nochunks
          Search all productions _e_x_c_e_p_t  chunks  that  match  the
          following _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.

     The syntax of _p_a_t_t_e_r_n is exactly the syntax of a sequence of
     clauses within a Soar production.  In addition, the symbol *
     may be used as a wildcard for an attribute or  value.   Note
     that variables names do not have to match the specific names
     used in productions.

EXAMPLES
     Find productions that test that some  object  gumby  has  an
     attribute  alive with value t.  In addition, limit the rules
     to only those that test an operator named foo:

production-find(n)        Soar Commands        production-find(n)



          production-find {(<s> ^gumby <gv> ^operator.name foo)(<gv> ^alive t)}
9
     Find productions that propose the operator foo:

          production-find -rhs {(<x> ^operator <op> +)(<op> ^name foo)}
9
     Find chunks that test the attribute ^pokey:

          production-find -chunks {(<x> ^pokey *)}
9

WARNINGS
     Note that curly braces or double quotes must be used  around
     the _p_a_t_t_e_r_n to override the normal Tcl parsing.
