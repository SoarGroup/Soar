DESCRIPTION
     The print command is used to  print  items  from  production
     memory  or  working  memory.   It  can take several kinds of
     arguments.  When printing items  from  working  memory,  the
     Soar  objects are printed unless the -internal flag is used,
     in which case the wmes themselves are printed.
      The _i_t_e_ms to be printed may be one of the following:

     _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n-_n_a_m_e
          print the production named _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n-_n_a_m_e

     -_a_l_l print the names of all productions currently loaded

     -_c_h_u_n_k_s
          print the names of all chunks currently loaded

     -_d_e_f_a_u_l_t_s
          print the names of all  default  productions  currently
          loaded

     -_j_u_s_t_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_s
          print the names of all justifications currently loaded

     -_u_s_e_r
          print the  names  of  all  user  productions  currently
          loaded

     _i_d_e_n_t_i_f_i_e_r
          print the object  _i_d_e_n_t_i_f_i_e_r.   _i_d_e_n_t_i_f_i_e_r  must  be  a
          valid Soar symbol.

     _i_n_t_e_g_e_r
          print the object in working  memory  with  the  timetag
          _i_n_t_e_g_e_r

     _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
          print the object whose working memory elements matching

          the  given  _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  The pattern is interpreted by the
          Soar kernel so it must be surrounded by curly braces or
          double  quotes to avoid being parsed by Tcl.  A _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
          has the following form:

                 (_i_d_e_n_t_i_f_i_e_r ^_a_t_t_r_i_b_u_t_e _v_a_l_u_e [+])
9
     The _p_a_t_t_e_r_n is surrounded by parentheses.   The  _i_d_e_n_t_i_f_i_e_r,
     _a_t_t_r_i_b_u_t_e, and _v_a_l_u_e must be valid Soar symbols or the wild-
     card symbol * which matches all occurences.  The optional  +
     symbol restricts pattern matches to acceptable preferences.


OPTIONS
     All options apply only to arguments which follow them on the
     command line.

     -depth _n
          This option overrides the default printing  depth  (see
          the default-print-depth command for more detail).  Note
          that a -depth 0 argument is meaningful only with accom-
          panying  integer and pattern arguments.  It causes only
          the matching working memory  elements  to  be  printed,
          instead of all elements whose identifier is an identif-
          ier in one of the matching working memory elements.

     -internal
          Specifies that items should be printed in their  inter-
          nal  form.   For productions, this means leaving condi-
          tions in their reordered (rete net) form.  For  working
          memory,  this  means  printing  the individual elements
          with their timetags, rather than the objects.

     -full
          When printing productions, print the whole  production.
          This is the default when printing a named production.

     -name
          When printing productions, print only the name and  not
          the  whole production.  This is the default when print-
          ing any catorgory of productions, as opposed to a named
          production.

     -stack
          Specifies that the Soar goal stack should  be  printed.
          By  default  this  includes  both states and operators.
          The stack listing  can  be  restricted  by  adding  the
          -states   and   -operator  restrictions.   Giving  both
          options is equivalent to the default.   The  predefined
          alias 'ps' is the same as print -stack.

print(n)                  Soar Commands                  print(n)



EXAMPLES
     print -internal {(s1 ^* v2)}
          Print the working memory elements (and their  timetags)
          which have the identifier s1 as object and v2 as value.

     print -stack
          Print the Soar stack which includes states  and  opera-
          tors.

     print -internal -full prodname
          Print the named production in its RETE form.

     print -user
          Print the  names  of  all  user  productions  currently
          loaded.


WARNINGS
     The order of options and arguments to the print  command  do
     matter:  options apply only to arguments which follow them.


      print -chunks -full
          prints only the names of chunks, while

      print -full -chunks
          prints the entire chunk for all chunks.
