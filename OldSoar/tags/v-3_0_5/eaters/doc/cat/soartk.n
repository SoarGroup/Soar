NAME
     soartk - Soar system with Tk extension

SYNOPSIS
     soartk [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s]
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
     This command creates new  Soar  interpreters  identified  by
     given  _n_a_m_es.   The various options specify any special ini-
     tialization conditions, if any.  The most  important  option
     is  the  _t_y_p_e which indicates what type of interpreter is to
     be created and must be one of the following values:

     -agent
          Create agent interpreter(s).  This includes Tcl + Tk  +
          Soar  if  Tk  is enabled, otherwise this includes Tcl +
          Soar.

     -wish
          Create wish interpreter(s).  Wish includes  Tcl  +  Tk.
          This is available only if Tk is enabled.

     -tclsh
          Create tclsh interpreter(s).  Tclsh includes only Tcl.

     One or more _n_a_m_es may be given after the above _t_y_p_es.  If no
     _t_y_p_e  is  given  on the command line when Soar is invoked, a
     single -agent interpreter is created  with  the  _n_a_m_e  soar.
     Within  Soar,  it  is  an error to call this command without
     specifying some interpreter _n_a_m_e to create.

     Tk is enabled if Soar has  been  compiled  with  the  USE_TK
     option,  the  $DISPLAY  environment variable is set, and the
     -noTk option has not been given on  the  command  line  (see
     below).

     Once  the  Soar  Tcl/Tk  system  has  started,  the  command
     create-interp can be used to add additional interpreters.


OPTIONS
     Environment variables used below are assumed to  be  defined
     in the Unix shell used to start Soar.

     -path
          Use the given sequence of directories to scan for agent
          initialization  files.   The  sequence  is  a colon (:)
          separated list of directories.  The  default  value  is

          ".:$HOME",  where  $HOME  is the user's home directory.
          Agent initialization files  are  assumed  to  be  named
          _n_a_m_e.soar.

     -display
          Place the top-level window associated with  the  inter-
          preter  on  the  indicated  display.  The value of this
          option follows standard X  conventions  for  specifying
          displays.   The default is the value of $DISPLAY.  This
          only applies to wish-based shells.

     -file
          Specifies a file to run immediately after defining  the
          last  interpreter.   This  only  applies  when invoking
          Soar.

     -geometry
          Specifies the geometry (width, height,  and  placement)
          of  the  top-level  window  associated  with the inter-
          preter.  The value of this option  follows  standard  X
          conventions   for  specifying  geometries.   This  only
          applies to wish-based shells.

     -help
          Lists all available options for this command.

     -noTk
          Do not use  Tk  when  creating  any  subsequent  inter-
          preters.   This  option applies to the rest of the com-
          mand line.

     -sync
          Use synchronous X server updates  with  all  subsequent
          wish-based  interpreter  windows.  This applies only to
          wish-based shells.

     -useIPC
          Enables IPCs (registered with Xserver) for  all  inter-
          preters.   This  option applies to the rest of the com-
          mand line.

     -verbose
          Print diagnostic  information  about  options  as  each
          interpreter is defined.


EXAMPLES
     The following example starts Soar with two agents named fred
     and wilma and a single wish interpreter named bedrock.  This
     setup might be used to run a simulator in  the  wish  inter-
     preter  bedrock  that the agents fred and wilma can interact
     in.

     The next example is similar to the one  above,  except  that
     the  simulator  display  will  be  moved  to  the  X display
     sgi1:0.0.  Also, the switch -v has been  added  to  indicate
     that  we  want detailed information about defined options as
     each interpreter is created.  Note that all option names may
     be abbreviated to any prefix which uniquely distinguishes it
     from the other options.

          soartk -v -agent fred wilma -display sgi1:0.0 -wish bedrock
9
     This example has the extra option -foo bar.  Since  this  is
     not  recognized as a valid command line option, it is passed
     on to each interpreter defined on the  command  line.   This
     information appears in the Tcl variable argv and can be used
     to pass startup information to user-defined Tcl procedures.

          soartk -foo bar -agent fred wilma -wish bedrock
