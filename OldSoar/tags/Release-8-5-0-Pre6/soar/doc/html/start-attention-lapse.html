</pre><H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<P>
This command, which should not normally be called by the user or
an agent (attention lapses normally get started automatically
by the architecture), sets the "attention-lapsing" variable to 
TRUE (1), and starts tracking the amount of real time that should pass before
ending the lapse (with wake_from_attention_lapse).  The duration
of the lapse is the number of milleseconds specified by the
argument to this command (in real time).

<P>
</pre><H2>WARNINGS</H2>
The compile time options </B></I> REAL_TIME_BEHAVIOR<I> and </I></B>ATTENTION_LAPSE<I>
must be enabled for this functionality.
