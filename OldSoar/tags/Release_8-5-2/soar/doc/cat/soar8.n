_________________________________________________________________

NAME
     soar8 - Enable/Disable Soar8 mode

SYNOPSIS
     soar8  [-on | -off]
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
     The soar8 allows users to toggle between the Soar  8  metho-
     dology  and  the  Soar  7 methodology.  The default value is
     -on.  If an enabling or disabling _s_t_a_t_u_s of -on or  -off  is
     given, then the Soar 8 (-on) or Soar 7 (-off) methodology is
     employed.  If no _s_t_a_t_u_s is given,  then  the  current  soar8
     status is printed.  Users can toggle between modes ONLY when
     production memory and working memory are both  empty.   This
     means  that  users  must  either  change the mode at startup
     before any productions  are  loaded,  or  must  first  issue
     "excise  -all"  (which  does  an "init-soar" as well) before
     changing modes.  Note that  there  are  differences  in  the
     preference  mechanism  and  in  operator  termination (among
     other things) between Soar 8 and Soar 7.  Users should  read
     the Soar 8.2 Release Notes for more details.


OPTIONS
     -on  Soar  will  run  using  Soar  8  methodology   (initial
          default)

     -off Soar will run using Soar 7 methodology


WARNINGS
     Production memory and working memory must be empty to switch
     between modes.
