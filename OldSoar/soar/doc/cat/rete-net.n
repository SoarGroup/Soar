NAME
     rete-net - Save and restore the Rete net

SYNOPSIS
     rete-net {-_s_a_v_e | -_l_o_a_d} _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

DESCRIPTION
     The rete-net command saves and restores  the  state  of  the
     Rete network.  This command provides a fast method of saving
     and loading productions  since  a  binary  format  is  used.
     rete-net  files  are  portable across platforms that support
     Soar.  The action must be one of the following:

     -save
          Save the Rete network in the given _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.  The  Rete
          network  cannot be saved while there are justifications
          present.  These can be eliminated by  using  the  init-
          soar command.

     -load
          Load the productions stored in _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e into  the  Rete
          network.  In order to load productions stored in binary
          form, working memory and production memory must both be
          empty.   Working  memory  can  be  emptied by using the
          init-soar command.  Production memory can be emptied by
          using the excise -all command.

     If the _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e contains a suffix of ".Z", then the file  is
     compressed  automatically  when it is saved and uncompressed
     when it is loaded.


WARNINGS
     Compressed files may not be portable to another platform  is
     that platform does not support the same uncompress utility.
