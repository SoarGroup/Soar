NAME
     add-wme - Add a working memory element

SYNOPSIS
     add-wme _i_d [^]_a_t_t_r_i_b_u_t_e _v_a_l_u_e [+]
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
     This command adds an element to working memory  and  returns
     the timetag of the wme.  In effect, Soar's working memory is
     surgically altered by this command.  add-wme adds a new  wme
     with  the  given  _i_d, _a_t_t_r_i_b_u_t_e, _v_a_l_u_e, and optional _p_r_e_f_e_r_-
     _e_n_c_e.  The given _i_d must be  an  existing  identifier.   The
     _a_t_t_r_i_b_u_t_e  and _v_a_l_u_e fields can be any Soar symbol.  If * is
     given in the _a_t_t_r_i_b_u_t_e or _v_a_l_u_e field, Soar  creates  a  new
     identifier  (symbol)  for  that field.  If the _p_r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e is
     given, it can only have the value  +  to  indicate  that  an
     acceptable preference should be created for this wme.

     add-wme is often used by an input function to update  Soar's
     information about the state of the external world.


EXAMPLES
     This example adds the attribute/value  pair  "message-status
     received" to the identifier (symbol) S1:

          add-wme S1 ^message-status received
9
     This example adds an attribute/value pair with an acceptable
     preference  to the identifier (symbol) Z2.  The attribute is
     "message" and the value is a unique identifier generated  by
     Soar.   Note  that since the ^ is optional, it has been left
     off in this case.

          add-wme Z2 message * +

     ple, the chunker can't backtrace through  wmes  created  via
     add-wme.   Removing  input  wmes or context/impasse wmes may
     have unexpected side effects.  _Y_o_u'_v_e _b_e_e_n _w_a_r_n_e_d.
