.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBquit\fR
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command quits Soar.  It calls any registered Soar termination
callbacks, closes any open log files, and exits the process.  This
also performs any Tcl related cleanup as would be done for the
Tcl \fBexit\fR command.  The Tcl \fBexit\fR command is redefined
in Soar to use this command.
