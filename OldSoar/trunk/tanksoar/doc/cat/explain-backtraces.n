NAME
     explain-backtraces - Interpret chunking backtraces

SYNOPSIS
     explain-backtraces [_p_r_o_d_n_a_m_e_n_a_m_e [_n | -full] ]
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
     This command provides some interpretation of backtraces gen-
     erated  during chunking.  If no option is given, then a list
     of all chunks and justifications is printed.

     The two most useful variants are explain-backtraces _p_r_o_d_n_a_m_e
     and  explain-backtraces _n_a_m_e _n.  The first variant lists all
     of the conditions for the named chunk or justification,  and
     the    _g_r_o_u_n_d   which   resulted   in   inclusion   in   the
     chunk/justification.  A _g_r_o_u_n_d is a working  memory  element
     (WME) which was tested in the supergoal.  Just knowing which
     WME  was  tested  may  be  enough   to   explain   why   the
     chunk/justification  exists.   If not, the conditions can be
     listed with an integer value.  This value  can  be  used  in
     explain-backtraces  _n_a_m_e  _n  to obtain a list of the produc-
     tions  which  fired  to  obtain  this   condition   in   the
     chunk/justification  (and  the crucial WMEs tested along the
     way).  Why use an integer value to  specify  the  condition?
     To save a big parsing job.


OPTIONS
     If an option is given, it must match one  of  the  following
     forms:

     _n_a_m_e list all conditions and grounds for the chunk  or  jus-
          tification named _n_a_m_e

     _n_a_m_e -full
          provide a backtrace  for  the  chunk  or  justification
          named _n_a_m_e

     _n_a_m_e _n
          explain why condition number _n is in the chunk or  jus-
          tification


WARNINGS
     save_backtraces mode must be on when a chunk  or  justifica-
     tion  is  created  or  no  explanation  will  be  available.
     Explain-backtraces mode is toggled using the save_backtraces
     boolean  variable.  save_backtraces is off by default.  When

     explain mode is on, more memory is used, and building chunks
     and justifications will be slower.
