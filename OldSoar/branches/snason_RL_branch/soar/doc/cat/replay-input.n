NAME
     replay-input - Replay agent commands from a file during the
     appropriate decision cycle

SYNOPSIS
     replay-input _a_c_t_i_o_n
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       This command may be used to start and stop the reading of
       input  function  commands  from  a  file  created  by  the
       "capture-input" command.  The routine replay-input-wme is  
       registered  as  an  input function to read input wmes from 
       the file decision cycle  by  decision cycle.  If an EOF is 
       reached, the file is closed and the  callback removed.
       Use the command capture-input to create the file.

     The _a_c_t_i_o_n must be one of the following:

     -open _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e
          A log file named _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e is opened and input replay is
          initiated.

     -query
          Returns open  if  replaying  is  active  or  closed  if
          replaying is not active.

     -off Close the input file.


EXAMPLES
     This opens the input file foo.in and will register the call-
     back  function  to  execute  the  commands decision cycle by
     decision cycle:

          replay-input -open foo.in
9
     This terminates replaying (removes the callback) and  closes
     the open log file:

          replay-input -off
9
