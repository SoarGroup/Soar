     -wmes | 0 | 1 | 2]
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
     This command prints partial match information for a selected
     production.   If issued at the end of the Decision Phase, it
     also prints the current set of productions that are about to
     fire or retract in the next preference phase.  This informa-
     tion is useful  for  determining  what  changes  to  working
     memory  are  necessary  in  order  to achieve a match of the
     left-hand sides of productions.

     If no production name is given, then it is assumed that  the
     user desires information about the match set, including both
     assertions and retractions.


OPTIONS
     Normally both assertions and retractions are printed by  the
     matches  command.   This  can be restricted using one of the
     following options:

     -assertions
          List only those productions about to fire

     -retractions
          List only those productions about to retract

     The  optional  detail  specifies  the  kind  of  information
     desired  and  must  be one of the following (the 0 option is
     the default):

     -count or -names or 0
          Print just the partial match counts.  If the match  set
          is being printed, then print just the production names.

     -timetags or 1
          Print the same information as the  -count  option  plus
          the timetags of wmes at the the first failing condition

     -wmes or 2
          Print the same  information  as  the  -timetags  option

matches(n)                Soar Commands                matches(n)



          except print the full wmes rather than just their time-
          tags


EXAMPLES
     This example prints the productions which are about to  fire
     and  the  wmes that match the productions on their left-hand
     sides:

          matches -assertions -wmes
9
     This example prints the wme timetags for  a  single  produc-
     tion.   This  example  takes  advantage of the unique prefix
     abbreviation feature of switches.

          matches -t my*first*production
9
WARNINGS
     In Soar 8, the Decision Phase occurs in the  middle  of  the
     Decision  Cycle, followed by the Apply Phase.  Therefore, at
     the end of the Decision Cycle, productions will have already
     fired  and  the  "matches" command will not be very helpful.
     To examine the match information in  immediately  after  the
     Decision  Phase in Soar 8, users can implement either of the
     following callbacks:

          monitor -add {matches -wmes} after-decision-phase-cycle
9
          monitor -add {stop-soar -self} after-decision-phase-cycle
9
     The first example can use any options to  the  matches  com-
     mand,  whatever  the  user  finds  most helpful.  The second
     option, which stops Soar at the end of the  Decision  Phase,
     offers  the  most  flexibility  for debugging.  It is recom-
     mended that users issue this callback  for  all  agents,  so
     they  don't get out of synch when running.  Once the produc-
     tions have been debugged, the monitors can be deleted.
