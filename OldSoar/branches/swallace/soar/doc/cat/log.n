DESCRIPTION
     This command records the prompts,  commands,  printing,  and
     command  results  that  are  printed  to  stdout for a given
     agent.  The _a_c_t_i_o_n must be one of the following:

     -new _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e
          A log file named _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e is  created  and  logging  is
          initiated.

     -existing _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e
          An existing log file named _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e is opened and  log-
          ging is added to the end of the file.

     -add _s_t_r_i_n_g
          Add the given _s_t_r_i_n_g to the open log file

     -query
          Returns open if logging is active or closed if  logging
          is not active.

     -off Close the open log file.


EXAMPLES
     This initiates logging and places the record in foo.log:

          log -new foo.log
9
     This appends log data to an existing foo.log file:

          log -existing foo.log
9
     This terminates logging and closes the open log file:

          log -off
9
