max-chunks(n)             Soar Commands             max-chunks(n)



_________________________________________________________________

NAME
     max-chunks - Set or list the maximum chunk count

SYNOPSIS
     max-chunks [_c_o_u_n_t]
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
     This command sets and prints the maximum  number  of  chunks
     that can be created in a single decision cycle.  If _c_o_u_n_t is
     not given, this command prints the maximum number of  chunks
     that  can be created.  If _c_o_u_n_t is given, it must be a posi-
     tive integer and is used  to  reset  the  number  of  chunks
     allowed.

     The "max-chunks" parameter controls the  maximum  number  of
     chunks  that  can  be  created  in  a single decision cycle.
     After this limit has been reached in a decision cycle,  Soar
     proceeds  to decision phase even if quiescence hasn't really
     been reached yet.  The default initial setting of the  "max-
     chunks" parameter is 50.

     In Soar8, chunks may be built during both the Propose  Phase
     or  the  Apply  Phase.   If  Soar8 builds more than the max-
     chunks limit in either of these phases,  Soar8  proceeds  to
     the  next  phase  (either Decision or Output) even if quies-
     cence has not been reached.

     If max-chunks are reached, and Soar moves  on  to  the  next
     phase, a warning message is printed.

EXAMPLES
     The command issued with no arguments,  returns  the  maximum
     chunk count:

          max-chunks
9
     The next example makes use of Tcl command abbreviation while
     setting the max-chunks to 100:

          max-c  100
9


VARIABLE
     Note that the commandname uses dashes to separate the words.
     There  is  also  a  Soar  variable "max_chunks" (with under-
     scores) that can be used to set the chunk limit through  the

max-chunks(n)             Soar Commands             max-chunks(n)



     the   Tcl   _s_e_t  command.   If  _c_o_u_n_t  is  not  given,  'set
     max_chunks' prints the maximum number of chunks that can  be
     created.   If  _c_o_u_n_t is given, it must be a positive integer
     and is used to reset the number of chunks allowed.
