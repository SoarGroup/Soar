DESCRIPTION
     save-backtraces is a Soar variable which through the Tcl _s_e_t
     command, enables and disables the the  saving of backtracing
     information.  It must be on for the explain-backtraces  com-
     mand  to provide backtracing information.  If an enabling or
     disabling _s_t_a_t_u_s of on or  off  is  given,  then  the  save-
     backtraces  are  set  to that state.  If no _s_t_a_t_u_s is given,
     then the current  save-backtraces  status  is  printed.   At
     startup, save-backtraces is initially enabled.
