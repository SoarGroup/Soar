Manual things I changed-

Removed "Soar and Tcl" chapter, added blockscode and Tcl-I/O appendices
and updated most references to non-existing or newly existing sections

Intro-
Updated. Mostly. The part about having a bibliography is a lie.


Architecture-
p. 14, I rewrote the blocks code to use an elaboration to compute 'clear', and described it here.
p. 22, updated for numeric-indifferent preferences, also removed reference to 'parallel' preference,
p. 33, there was a paragraph explaining aggressive operator no-change detection, which I removed

Syntax-
p. 42 , section 3.3.3, I mentioned :interrupt here, this was a little difficult to place - also mentioned on
		p. 62, probably should be mentioned on p. 94
p. 60 , added numeric-indifferent to table
p. 61 , section 3.3.6.5 , didn't change to reflect numeric-indifferent preferences
p. 62 , I described the :interrupt functionality here.  
p. 74 , rewrote the last paragraph in section 3.5.2.
        section 3.5.3, I commented out the second sentence in the second paragraph which said
        
        %This is a generally a good idea when using input, since the input
	%function may change the information on the link before the Soar program has
	%finished using it.
	
	since the production doesn't seem to handle this problem.
     
Learning-
I haven't touched this chapter

Soar and Tcl-
Removed this chapter

Interface-
I haven't checked that all old commands work as described, though I checked some.
p. 131, I added a watch command which is mentioned here, and described in section 5.3.8.5
p. 138, added numeric-indifferent-mode command
p. 141, section 5.4.2, I rewrote this description because this command changed
p. 142, section 5.4.3, "numeric-indifferent-mode" command, I decided to explain the details of the 	probabilistic selection here
p. 156, added several references to Appendix D, which has an example of Tcl & I/O functions
p. 158, hmm, I made this page look funny, need to fix
        
Appendix A-
I rewrote to use elaborations to compute 'clear'
I removed parallel & reconsider preferences

Appendix B & C - i think you can see for yourself.

Appendix D - I wrote this appendix. I hope the Tcl code is right, I tested it a bit, but was running out of time and patience. I also hope it is presented in a helpful way.
