# proposed by generic operator proposal in propose-mission-operator

# currently, this is very simple (the agent assumes it is at the origin)
# in general, the agent might try adding all of the waypoints until it
#  finds one it is at (in parallel or sequence, depending on how many
#  there are), or, if it's not at a waypoint, it might find the closest
#  one and try to get there from wherever it's at.
