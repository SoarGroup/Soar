\subsubsection*{Description}
 The \textbf{log}
 command allows users to save all user-interface input and output to a file. When Soar is logging to a file, everything typed by the user and everything printed by Soar is written to the file (in addition to the screen). 
 Invoke \textbf{log}
 with no arguments (or with \textbf{-q}
) to query the current logging status. Pass a filename to start logging to that file (relative to the command line interface's home directory (see the home command)). Use the \textbf{close}
 option to stop logging. 
\subsubsection*{Examples}
 To initiate logging and place the record in foo.log: \begin{verbatim}
log foo.log
\end{verbatim}
 To append log data to an existing foo.log file: \begin{verbatim}
log -A foo.log
\end{verbatim}
 To terminate logging and close the open log file: \begin{verbatim}
log -c
\end{verbatim}
\subsubsection*{Known Issues}
 Does not log everything when structured output is selected.
