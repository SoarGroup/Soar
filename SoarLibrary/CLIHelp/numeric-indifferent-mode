                                  Description

   The numeric-indifferent-mode command is used to select the method for
   combining numeric preferences. This command is only meaningful in
   indifferent-selection --random mode.

   The default procedure is --avg (average) which assigns a final value to an
   operator according to the rule:

     * If the operator has at least one numeric preference, assign it the
       value that is the average of all of its numeric preferences.
     * If the operator has no numeric preferences (but has been included in
       the indifferent selection through some combination of non-numeric
       preferences), assign it the value 50.

   The intended range of numeric-preference values for --avg mode is 0-100.

   The other combination option --sum assigns a final value according to the
   rule:

     * Add together any numeric preferences for the operator (defaulting to 0
       if there are none).
     * Assign the operator the value e^{PreferenceSum / AgentTemperature},
       where AgentTemperature is a compile-time constant currently set at
       25.0.

   Any real-numbered preference may be used in --sum mode.

   Once a value has been computed for each operator, the next operator is
   selected probabilistically, with each candidate operator's chance weighted
   by its computed value.
