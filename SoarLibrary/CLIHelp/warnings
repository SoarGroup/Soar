                                  Description

   Enables and disables the printing of warning messages. If an argument is
   specified, then the warnings are set to that state. If no argument is
   given, then the current warnings status is printed. At startup, warnings
   are initially enabled. If warnings are disabled using this command, then
   some warnings may still be printed, since some are considered too
   important to ignore.

   The warnings that are printed apply to the syntax of the productions, to
   notify the user when they are not in the correct syntax. When a lefthand
   side error is discovered (such as conditions that are not linked to a
   common state or impasse object), the production is generally loaded into
   production memory anyway, although this production may never match or may
   seriously slow down the matching process. In this case, a warning would be
   printed only if warnings were --on. Righthand side errors, such as
   preferences that are not linked to the state, usually result in the
   production not being loaded, and a warning regardless of the warnings
   setting.
