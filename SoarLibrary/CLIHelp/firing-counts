 firing-counts [n]
 firing-counts production_names

                                    Options

   If given, an option can take one of two forms -- an integer or a list of
   production names:

   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |n              |List the top n productions. If n is 0, only the         |
   |               |productions which haven't fired are listed              |
   |---------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
   |production_name|For each production in production_names, print how many |
   |               |times the production has fired                          |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

                                  Description

   The firing-counts command prints the number of times each production has
   fired; production names are given from most requently fired to least
   frequently fired. With no arguments, it lists all productions. If an
   integer argument, n, is given, only the top n productions are listed. If n
   is zero (0), only the productions that haven't fired at all are listed. If
   one or more production names are given as arguments, only firing counts
   for these productions are printed.

   Note that firing counts are reset by a call to init-soar.

                                    Examples

   This example prints the 10 productions which have fired the most times
   along with their firing counts:

 firing-counts 10

   This example prints the firing counts of productions my*first*production
   and my*second*production:

 firing-counts my*first*production my*second*production


                                    Warnings

   Firing-counts are reset to zero after an init-soar.

   NB: This command is slow, because the sorting takes time O(n*log n)
