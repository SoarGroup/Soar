                                  Description

   The sp command creates a new production and loads it into production
   memory. production_body is a single argument parsed by the Soar kernel, so
   it should be enclosed in curly braces to avoid being parsed by other
   scripting languages that might be in the same proces. The overall syntax
   of a rule is as follows:

   name
       ["documentation-string"]
       [FLAG*]
       LHS
       -->
       RHS

   The first element of a rule is its name. Conventions for names are given
   in the Soar Users Manual. If given, the documentation-string must be
   enclosed in double quotes. Optional flags define the type of rule and the
   form of support its right-hand side assertions will receive. The specific
   flags are listed in a separate section below. The LHS defines the
   left-hand side of the production and specifies the conditions under which
   the rule can be fired. Its syntax is given in detail in a subsequent
   section. The --> symbol serves to separate the LHS and RHS portions. The
   RHS defines the right-hand side of the production and specifies the
   assertions to be made and the actions to be performed when the rule fires.
   The syntax of the allowable right-hand side actions are given in a later
   section. The Soar Users Manual gives an elaborate discussion of the design
   and coding of productions. Please see that reference for tutorial
   information about productions.

   If the name of the new production is the same as an existing one, the old
   production will be overwritten (excised).

   RULE FLAGS

   The optional FLAGs are given below. Note that these switches are preceeded
   by a colon instead of a dash -- this is a Soar parser convention.

 :o-support      specifies that all the RHS actions are to be given
                 o-support when the production fires

 :no-support     specifies that all the RHS actions are only to be given
                 i-support when the production fires

 :default        specifies that this production is a default production
                 (this matters for excise -task and watch task)

 :chunk          specifies that this production is a chunk
                 (this matters for learn trace)

 :interrupt      specifies that Soar should stop running when this
                 production matches but before it fires
                 (this is a useful debugging tool)

   Multiple flags may be used, but not both of o-support and no-support.

   Although you could force your productions to provide O-support or
   I-support by using these commands --- regardless of the structure of the
   conditions and actions of the production --- this is not proper coding
   style. The o-support and no-support flags are included to help with
   debugging, but should not be used in a standard Soar program.

                                    Examples

 sp {blocks*create-problem-space
      "This creates the top-level space"
      (state <s1> ^superstate nil)
      -->
      (<s1> ^name solve-blocks-world ^problem-space <p1>)
      (<p1> ^name blocks-world)
 }
