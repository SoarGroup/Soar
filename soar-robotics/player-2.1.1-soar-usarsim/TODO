writelog:
+ Add support for logging to multiple files during one execution of Player.
  I.e., client-side control of logfile name.  Add textbox to playervcr to
  allow the user to change it.

playernav:
+ Need emergency STOP buttons: one per bot, plus an ALL STOP.
  Probably should send it directly to the underlying position device,
  but passing through the planner might be sufficient.

wavefront:
+ Add dynamic replanning; use sensor inputs (generalized somehow, or
  laser-specific?) to modify a local overlay on the given map, and
  periodically (but quickly) replan the best path to goal.

+ Speed up C-cspace generation.  Or at least support caching it to a file.
  Ideally this would happen automagically, making use of a hash function to
  determine when the C-space should be regenerated.

- Stop the robot if only alwayson is subscribed.

sicklms200:
- Figure out why I'm having so much trouble talking to the SICKs in the
  obots.  Is it the USB-serial widgets?  Can the retry mechanism be made
  more persistent/robust somehow?
