 * @brief A range sensor

Receive data from a range sensor, such as a laser scannar, sonar array or IR
array.

@section properties Recommended Properties

The following properties are recommended to be provided by drivers supporting
this interface, depending on device type.

@subsection laserprops Laser scanner devices

(string) type:     Type of device. For human debugging rather than client usage.

@subsection sonarprops Sonar array devices

(string) type:     Type of device. For human debugging rather than client usage.

@subsection irprops IR array devices

(string) type:     Type of device. For human debugging rather than client usage.
