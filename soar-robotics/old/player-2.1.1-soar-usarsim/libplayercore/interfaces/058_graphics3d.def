* @brief Three-dimensional graphics interface

The @p graphics3d interface provides an interface to graphics
devices. Drivers can implement this interface to provide clients and
other drivers with graphics output.

The interface uses an openGL style of command where a type is specified along
with a series of verticies. The interpretation depends on the command type

Graphics items should be accumulated until an explicit clear command is issued
