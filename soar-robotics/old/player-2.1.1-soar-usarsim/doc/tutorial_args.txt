@brief Parsing command-line arguments

If you would like to pass command line arguments to your Player client
programs you can use the getopt feature provided by unistd.h.

\dontinclude args.h
\skipline unistd

You must supply a series of characters in optflags, which are the legitimate
options to you program.  If the characher is followed by a colon (:) then
that option requires an additional parameter.  These parameters are returned
as const char* so you must use functions like atoi() or atof() if you would
like numerical results.

\skip parse_args
\until end parse_args

It is also often helpfull to include a short output function that explains
the option parameters to your program.

@verbatim
USAGE:  myprogram [options]

Where [options] can be:
  -h <hostname>  : hostname to connect to (default: localhost)
  -p <port>      : port where Player will listen (default: 6665)
  -i <index>     : device index (default: 0)
  -d <level>     : debug message level (0 = none -- 9 = all)
  -u <rate>      : set server update rate to <rate> in Hz
  -m <datamode>  : set server data delivery mode
                      PLAYER_DATAMODE_PUSH = 1
                      PLAYER_DATAMODE_PULL = 2
@endverbatim

\skip print_usage
\until end print_usage
