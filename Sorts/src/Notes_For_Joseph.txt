I changed the call in ORTSInterface to look up the group pointer in the sgo to remove dead objects.
Also, I changed the pGroupManager.addGroup(SGO*) function to be void, it can
set the SGO->SGG pointer itself (it used to return the SGG ptr). I fixed the
call in ORTSInterface to work with that.

I added a destructor to OrtsInterface to delete all the SoarGameObjects in
objectMap.
