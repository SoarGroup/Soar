\fISUBCOMMAND\fR
[\&.\&.\&.]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBscons\-time\fR
command runs an SCons configuration through a standard set of profiled timings and can extract and graph information from the resulting profiles and log files of those timings\&. The action to be performed by the
\fBscons\-time\fR
script is specified by a subcommand, the first argument on the command line\&. See the
SUBCOMMANDS
section below for information about the operation of specific subcommands\&.
.PP
The basic way to use
\fBscons\-time\fR
is to run the
\fBscons\-time run\fR
subcommand (possibly multiple times) to generate profile and log file output, and then use one of the other subcommands to display the results captured in the profiles and log files for a particular kind of information: function timings (the
\fBscons\-time func\fR
subcommand), total memory used (the
\fBscons\-time mem\fR
subcommand), object counts (the
\fBscons\-time obj\fR
subcommand) and overall execution time (the
\fBscons\-time time\fR
subcommand)\&. Options exist to place and find the profiles and log files in separate directories, to generate the output in a format suitable for graphing with the
\fBgnuplot\fR(1)
program, and so on\&.
.PP
There are two basic ways the
\fBscons\-time run\fR
subcommand is intended to be used to gather timing statistics for a configuration\&. One is to use the
\fB\-\-svn=\fR
option to test a configuration against a list of revisions from the SCons Subversion repository\&. This will generate a profile and timing log file for every revision listed with the
\fB\-\-number=\fR
option, and can be used to look at the impact of committed changes to the SCons code base on a particular configuration over time\&.
.PP
The other way is to profile incremental changes to a local SCons code base during a development cycle\-\-that is, to look at the performance impact of changes you\*(Aqre making in the local tree\&. In this mode, you run the
\fBscons\-time run\fR
subcommand
\fIwithout\fR
the
\fB\-\-svn=\fR
option, in which case it simply looks in the profile/log file output directory (the current directory by default) and automatically figures out the
\fInext\fR
run number for the output profile and log file\&. Used in this way, the development cycle goes something like: make a change to SCons; run
\fBscons\-time run\fR
to profile it against a specific configuration; make another change to SCons; run
\fBscons\-time run\fR
again to profile it; etc\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The
\fBscons\-time\fR
command only supports a few global options:
.PP
\-h, \-\-help
.RS 4
Displays the global help text and exits, identical to the
\fBscons\-time help\fR
subcommand\&.
.RE
.PP
\-V, \-\-version
.RS 4
Displays the
\fBscons\-time\fR

.RE
.PP
Most functionality is controlled by options to the individual subcommands\&. See the next section for information about individual subcommand options\&.
.SH "SUBCOMMANDS"
.PP
The
\fBscons\-time\fR
command supports the following individual subcommands\&.
.SS "The func Subcommand"

.PP
The
\fBscons\-time func\fR
subcommand displays timing information for a specific Python function within SCons\&. By default, it extracts information about the
\fB_main\fR() function, which includes the Python profiler timing for all of SCons\&.
.PP
The
\fBscons\-time func\fR
subcommand extracts function timing information from all the specified file arguments, which should be Python profiler output files\&. (Normally, these would be
\fB*\&.prof\fR
files generated by the
\fBscons\-time run\fR
subcommand, but they can actually be generated by any Python profiler invocation\&.) All file name arguments will be globbed for on\-disk files\&.
.PP
If no arguments are specified, then function timing information will be extracted from all
\fB*\&.prof\fR
files, or the subset of them with a prefix specified by the
\fB\-p\fR
option\&.

The

\fBscons\-time run\fR
subcommand is the basic subcommand for profiling a specific configuration against a version of SCons\&.
.PP
The configuration to be tested is specified as a list of files or directories that will be unpacked or copied into a temporary directory in which SCons will be invoked\&. The
\fBscons\-time run\fR
subcommand understands file suffixes like
\fB\&.tar\fR,
\fB\&.tar\&.gz\fR,
\fB\&.tgz\fR
and
\fB\&.zip\fR
and will unpack their contents into a temporary directory\&. If more than one argument is specified, each one will be unpacked or copied into the temporary directory "on top of" the previous archives or directories, so the expectation is that multiple specified archives share the same directory layout\&.
.PP
Once the file or directory arguments are unpacked or copied to the temporary directory, the
\fBscons\-time run\fR
subcommand runs the requested version of SCons against the configuration three times:
.PP
Startup
.RS 4
SCons is run with the
\fB\-\-help\fR
option so that just the SConscript files are read, and then the default help text is printed\&. This profiles just the perceived "overhead" of starting up SCons and processing the SConscript files\&.
.RE
.PP
Full build

SCons is run to build everything specified in the configuration\&. Specific targets to be passed in on the command l ine may be specified by the
\fBtargets\fR
keyword in a configuration file; see below for details\&.
.RE

Rebuild
.RS 4
SCons is run again on the same just\-built directory\&. If the dependencies in the SCons configuration are correct, this should be an up\-to\-date, "do nothing" rebuild\&.
.RE

Each invocation captures the output log file and a profile\&.

The
\fBscons\-time run\fR
subcommand supports the following options:

\-f FILE, \-\-file=FILE
.RS 4
Reads configuration information from the specified

configuration file for a hypothetical sample project:

# on top of the vanilla unpacked project tarball\&.
arguments = [\*(Aqproject\-1\&.2\&.tgz\*(Aq, \*(Aqproject\-SConscripts\&.tar\*(Aq]

subdir = \*(Aqproject\-1\&.2\*(Aq

# Set the prefix so output log files and profiles are named:
#     project\-000\-[012]\&.{log,prof}
#     project\-001\-[012]\&.{log,prof}
# etc\&.
prefix = \*(Aqproject\*(Aq

# configuration, so run their normal \&./configure script
# before we invoke SCons\&.
