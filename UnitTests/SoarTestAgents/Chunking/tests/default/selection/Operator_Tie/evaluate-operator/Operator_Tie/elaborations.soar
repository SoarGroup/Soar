###         A. pass-back-success
## if an operator leads to success and it is being
## tried out in a subgoal to evaluate another operator -
## give that second operator a success evaluation also

## Dangerous rule - for success test can lead to non-optimal path being learned
## this is the conservative version
sp {selection*pass-back-success    
   :default
   (state <s> ^superstate.superstate.operator <sso>
              ^evaluation.symbolic-value << required-success >>) # partial-success success >>)

          ^evaluation <e2> 
          ^superoperator.name)
   -->
   (<e2> ^symbolic-value partial-success)}

## Below is a safer way - using discounted expected value

sp {selection*pass-back-expected-value-discounted

### If all operators have been evaluated, and all have value novalue, and
### there is a operator being evaluated in a higher context, assign that
### operator novalue.
