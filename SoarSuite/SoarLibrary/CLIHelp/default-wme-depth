                                  Description

   The default-wme-depth command reflects the default depth used when working
   memory elements are printed (using the print command or wmes alias). The
   default value is 1. When the command is issued with no arguments,
   default-wme-depth returns the current value of the default depth. When
   followed by an integer value, default-wme-depth sets the default depth to
   the specified value. This default depth can be overridden on any
   particular call to the print or wmes command by explicitly using the
   --depth flag, e.g.,print --depth 10 args.

   By default, the print command prints objects in working memory, not just
   the individual working memory element. To limit the output to individual
   working memory elements, the --internal flag must also be specified in the
   print command. Thus when the print depth is 0, by default Soar prints the
   entire object, which is the same behavior as when the print depth is 1.
   But if --internal is also specified, then a depth of 0 prints just the
   individual WME, while a depth of 1 prints all WMEs which share that same
   identifier. This is true when printing timetags, identifiers or WME
   patterns.

   When the depth is greater than 1, the identifier links from the specified
   WME's will be followed, so that additional substructure is printed. For
   example, a depth of 2 means that the object specified by the identifier,
   wme-pattern, or timetag will be printed, along with all other objects
   whose identifiers appear as values of the first object. This may result in
   multiple copies of the same object being printed out. If --internal is
   also specified, then individuals WMEs and their timetags will be printed
   instead of the full objects.
