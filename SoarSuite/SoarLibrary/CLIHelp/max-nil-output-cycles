   |n|Maximum number of consecutive output cycles allowed without producing |

                                  Description

   This command sets and prints the maximum number of nil output cycles
   (output cycles that put nothing on the output link) allowed when running
   using run-til-output (run --output). If n is not given, this command
   prints the current number of nil-output-cycles allowed. If n is given, it
   must be a positive integer and is used to reset the maximum number of
   allowed nil output cycles.

   max-nil-output-cycles controls the maximum number of output cycles that
   generate no output allowed when a run --out command is issued. After this
   limit has been reached, Soar stops. The default initial setting of n is
   15.

                                    Examples

   The command issued with no arguments, returns the max empty output cycles
   allowed:

 max-nil-output-cycles

   to set the maximum number of empty output cycles in one phase to 25:

 max-nil-output-cycles 25
