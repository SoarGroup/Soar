                                  Description

   The max-chunks command is used to limit the maximum number of chunks that
   may be created during a decision cycle. The initial value of this variable
   is 50; allowable settings are any integer greater than 0.

   The chunking process will end after max-chunks chunks have been created,
   even if there are more results that have not been backtraced through to
   create chunks, and Soar will proceed to the next phase. A warning message
   is printed to notify the user that the limit has been reached.

   This limit is included in Soar to prevent getting stuck in an infinite
   loop during the chunking process. This could conceivably happen because
   newly-built chunks may match immediately and are fired immediately when
   this happens; this can in turn lead to additional chunks being formed,
   etc. If you see this warning, something is seriously wrong; Soar is unable
   to guarantee consistency of its internal structures. You should not
   continue execution of the Soar program in this situation; stop and
   determine whether your program needs to build more chunks or whether
   you've discovered a bug (in your program or in Soar itself).
