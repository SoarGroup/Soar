NAME
     echo - Echo message

SYNOPSIS
     echo [-_n_o_n_e_w_l_i_n_e] _a_r_g_s
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
     This command echos the _a_r_g_s to the  current  output  stream.
     This is normally stdout but can be set to a variety of chan-
     nels.  If an _a_r_g is -nonewline then no newline is printed at
     the  end  of  the  printed  strings.  Otherwise a newline is
     printed after printing all the  given  _a_r_g_s.  For  the  full
     details  of the redirection, see the command output-strings-
     destination.

     Users wanting to print variables and  data  to  the  screen,
     should  use  echo  rather  than the Tcl command "puts."  The
     echo command gets  redirected  to  the  appropriate  channel
     according to output-strings-destination;  the "puts" command
     does not.
