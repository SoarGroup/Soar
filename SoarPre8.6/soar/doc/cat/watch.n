NAME
     watch - Run-time tracing of Soar

SYNOPSIS
     watch [_l_e_v_e_l*] [-on | -off | -inc[lusive]]
     watch wmes [-on | -off | -inc[lusive] | filter-options]
     watch [ aliases | backtracing | loading ] [-on | -off ]
     watch [ learning ] [-noprint | -print | -fullprint ]
_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
     The watch command controls run-time tracing of  Soar.   With
     no  arguments,  this  command  prints  out the current watch
     status. The various _l_e_v_e_ls are used to  modify  the  current
     watch  settings.   Each _l_e_v_e_l can be indicated with either a
     number or a named flag as follows:

          0  none
          1  decisions
          2  phases
          3  productions
          4  wmes
          5  preferences
9
     The numerical arguments (0 - 5) do not take any arguments or
     modifiers.   They  inclusively  turn on all levels up to the
     number specified.  To use numerical arguments to turn off  a
     level,  specify  a number which is less than the level to be
     turned off.  For instance, to turn off watching  of  produc-
     tions,  specify  "watch 2" (or 1 or 0).  Numerical arguments
     are provided for shorthand convenience.  For  more  detailed
     control  over the watch settings, the named arguments should
     be used.

     For the named arguments, setting  either  the  -on  or  -off
     switch  selectively turns on or off only that setting.  Set-
     ting the -inclusive switch  (which  can  be  abbreviated  as
     -inc)  or  setting  no flag at all has the effect of setting
     all levels up to and  including  the  level  specified.  For
     example,    watch productions -on   selectively turns on the
     tracing of production firings/retractions; watch productions
     -off  selectively  turns it off again.  watch productions [-
     inc] turns on the tracing of productions and also  turns  on
     tracing  of  all  levels  below  productions:  decisions and
     phases, too.  Individual watch parameters  may  be  used  to
     modify  the  inclusive settings as well, selectively turning
     on or off any levels outside or inside the inclusive range.

watch(n)                  Soar Commands                  watch(n)



OPTIONS
     The following options are allowed (_s_t_a_t_u_s is given as either
     -on, -off, or -inclusive, -inc is the default):

     0 | none
          turns off all printing about Soar's internals

     1 | decisions _s_t_a_t_u_s
          controls  whether  state  and  operator  decisions  are
          printed as they are made

     2 | phases _s_t_a_t_u_s
          controls  whether  decisions  cycle  phase  names   are
          printed as Soar executes.

     3 | productions _s_t_a_t_u_s
          controls whether the names of productions  are  printed
          as  they  fire and retract.  See the optional arguments
          below    [-all|-chunks|-defaults|-justifications|-user]
          which  specify  which  types  of productions the _s_t_a_t_u_s
          argument refers to.

     4 | wmes
          controls the printing of working memory  elements  that
          are  added  and  deleted  as  productions are fired and
          retracted.

          To improve state tracing, the following filter-options
          are available to watch wmes for monitoring a specified
          object-attribute-value triplet:

               {-add-filter    _t_y_p_e _f_i_l_t_e_r} |
               {-remove-filter _t_y_p_e _f_i_l_t_e_r} |
               {-reset-filter  _t_y_p_e       } |
               {-list-filter   _t_y_p_e       }
9
          where:

               _t_y_p_e   = -adds | -removes | -both
               _f_i_l_t_e_r = {_i_d|*} {_a_t_t_r_i_b_u_t_e|*} {_v_a_l_u_e|*}
99
     5 | preferences _s_t_a_t_u_s
          controls  whether  the  preferences  generated  by  the
          traced  productions  are printed when those productions
          fire or retract.  When  a  production  fires,  all  the
          preferences it generates are printed. When it retracts,
          only the ones being removed from preference memory  are
          printed (i.e., the i-supported ones).

     -nowmes | -timetags | -fullwmes
          controls the level  of  detail  given  about  the  wmes

          matched  by  productions  whose firings and retractions
          are being traced.  Level 0|-nowmes means no information
          about the wmes is printed.  Level 1|-timetags means the
          wme timetags are printed.  Level 2|-fullwmes means  the
          whole wmes are printed.

     -all|-default|-user|-chunks|-justifications [_m_o_d_i_f_i_e_r]
          allows user to selectively control printing by  produc-
          tion *type* as they fire and retract, instead of having
          to watch ALL productions or none.  (NOTE:   these  args
          can  be  abbreviated  by the first char ONLY, otherwise
          the full arg must be specified.) The  modifier  can  be
          one of:

          -noprint|-print|-fullprint
9
          -noprint prints nothing,
          -print prints the production name,
          -fullprint prints the entire production. (not done as of 8.2)
9
     The following options control printing of other Soar parame-
     ters  and  are not part of the above set of levels which can
     be controlled as a group.

     aliases -on | -off
          controls the echoing of aliases as they are defined.

     backtracing -on | -off
          controls the printing of backtracing information when a
          chunk or justification is created.

     loading -on | -off
          controls the printing of '*' for each production loaded
          and a '#' for each production excised

     learning -noprint | -print | -fullprint
          controls the printing of chunks/justifications as  they
          are  created.  -noprint is don't print anything, -print
          prints just the names,  -fullprint  prints  the  entire
          chunk/justification.

EXAMPLES
     The most common uses of watch are by using the numeric argu-
     ments which indicate watch levels:

          watch 0
9     which turns off all printing  of  Soar  internals  (same  as
     watch none), or

          watch 3
9

watch(n)                  Soar Commands                  watch(n)



     which turns on printing of decisions, phases and productions
     (same  as  watch productions). Of course, individual options
     can be changed as well:

          watch 1 wmes -on
9     turns on printing of decisions and wmes, but not phases  and
     productions. While

          watch 4 phases -off
9     turns on printing of decisions, productions  and  wmes,  and
     turns phases off.

     To watch the firing and retraction of only USER productions:

          watch productions -user -print
9
     whereas this command would watch decisions, phases  and  ALL
     productions:

          watch productions
9


NOTE
     The pwatch command is used to watch named productions.
