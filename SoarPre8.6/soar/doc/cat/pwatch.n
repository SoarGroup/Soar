DESCRIPTION
     This command enables and disables the tracing of  production
     activity  for  individual  productions.   Both  firings  and
     retractions are printed.  If no _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n-_n_a_m_es are  given,
     this  command  lists the productions currently being traced.
     If one  or  more  _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n-_n_a_m_es  are  given,  tracing  is
     enabled (or disabled if -off is specified) for those produc-
     tions. Tracing persists until disabled or until the  produc-
     tion is excised.

     This command is orthogonal to the watch productions  mechan-
     ism.  See the watch command for more information.
