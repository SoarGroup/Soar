NAME
     stats - Print statistical data about Soar

SYNOPSIS
     stats [-_s_y_s_t_e_m [_s_t_a_t] | -_m_e_m_o_r_y [_s_t_a_t] |-_r_e_t_e [_s_t_a_t]]
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
     This command prints Soar internal  statistics.   The  _m_o_d_u_l_e
     indicates  the  component of interest.  If specified, _m_o_d_u_l_e
     must be one of -system, -memory, or -rete.  If  no  specific
     _s_t_a_t  is given for the specified _m_o_d_u_l_e, then all statistics
     are listed for that _m_o_d_u_l_e.  If no _m_o_d_u_l_e is given, then the
     -system statistics are listed.

     The -system module contains the following _s_t_a_ts:

          -default-production-count
          -user-production-count
          -chunk-count
          -justification-count
          -all-productions-count
          -dc-count
          -ec-count
          -ecs/dc
          -firings-count
          -firings/ec
          -wme-change-count
          -wme-addition-count
          -wme-removal-count
          -wme-count
          -wme-avg-count
          -wme-max-count
9
     If Soar has been compiled with the NO_TIMING_STUFF NOT  set,
     then  the  following  statistics  are  also available in the
     -system module:

          -total-time
          -ms/dc
          -ms/ec
          -ms/firing
          -ms/wme-change
9
     If Soar has been  compiled  with  the  DETAILED_TIMING_STATS
     SET, then the following statistics are also available in the
     -system module:

     The -memory module contains the following statistics:

          -total
          -overhead

     The -pool statistic is additionally  qualified  by  a  _p_o_o_l-
     _s_t_a_t_i_s_t_i_c  option.   If  this  option is not given, then all
     -memory  pool  statistics  are  printed.   If  given,  _p_o_o_l-
     _s_t_a_t_i_s_t_i_c must have one of the following forms:

     -total

     If no _a_s_p_e_c_t is given, then print all statistics  about  the
     given pool.  If given, _a_s_p_e_c_t must have one of the following
     forms:

               -used
               -free
               -item-size
               -total-bytes
9     The first two _a_s_p_e_c_ts are available only if  Soar  has  been
     compiled with MEMORY_POOL_STATS SET.

     The -rete module contains statistics for the following  node
     types:

          unhashed memory
          memory
          unhashed mem-pos
          mem-pos
          unhashed negative
          negative
          unhashed positive
          positive
          dummy top
          dummy matches
          conj. neg.
          conj. neg. partner
          production
          total
9     The total statistic gives a total count over all node types.

     A -rete statistic is obtained by specifying one of the above
     nodes  followed  by  a  _q_u_a_l_i_f_i_e_r.   The _q_u_a_l_i_f_i_e_r is one of
     -actual, -if-no-merging, and  -if-no-sharing.   The  -if-no-
     sharing  option  is only available if Soar has been compiled
     with the SHARING_FACTORS option SET.

     This prints all statistics in the -system module:

     This prints the number of io wme's:

          stats -memory -pool {io wme} -used

     embedded   space   character.    Hence,  the  name  must  be

     normal  Tcl  parsing of words separated by whitespace.  This

     This prints the actual number of unhashed negative nodes  in
     the Rete memory:

A NOTE ON TIMERS
     The current implementation of Soar uses a number  of  timers
     to  provide  time-based statistics for use in the stats com-
     mand calculations.  These timers are:

          total CPU time
          total kernel time
          phase kernel time (per phase)
          phase callbacks time (per phase)
          input function time
          output function time
9
     Total CPU time is calculated from the time a decision  cycle
     (or  number  of decision cycles) is initiated until stopped.
     Kernel time is the time spent in core  Soar  functions.   In
     this case, kernel time is defined as the all functions other
     than the execution of callbacks and  the  input  and  output
     functions.  The total kernel timer is only stopped for these
     functions.

     The phase timers (for the kernel and  callbacks)  track  the
     execution  time  for individual phases of the decision cycle
     (i.e., input phase, preference phase, working memory  phase,
     output  phase,  and decision phase).  Because there is over-
     head associated with turning these timers on  and  off,  the
     actual  kernel  time will always be greater than the derived
     kernel time (i.e., the sum of all the phase kernel  timers).
     Similarly,  the  total  CPU time will always be greater than
     the derived total (the sum of the other timers) because  the
     overhead  of  turning these timers on and off is included in
     the total CPU time.  In general, the times reported  by  the
     single  timers  should  always  be  greater  than  than  the
     corresponding derived time.  Additionally, as execution time
     increases, the difference between these two values will also
     increase.

     For those  concerned  about  the  performance  cost  of  the
     timers, all the run time timing calculations can be compiled
     out  of   the   code   by   defining   NO_TIMING_STUFF   (in
