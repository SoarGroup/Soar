_________________________________________________________________

NAME
     input-period - Set or list the input period

SYNOPSIS
     input-period [_p_e_r_i_o_d]
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
     This command is obsolete for Soar8.  In Soar8, input is done
     at the start of every decision cycle.

     This command controls the rate of input to the  Soar  agent.
     If  _p_e_r_i_o_d is not specified, this command prints the current
     input period.  If _p_e_r_i_o_d is specified, it  must  be  a  non-
     negative  integer  and is used to reset the input period.  A
     _p_e_r_i_o_d of 0 sets input to occur every elaboration  cycle.  A
     positive  value  for  _p_e_r_i_o_d  sets Soar to accept input only
     every nth _p_e_r_i_o_d decision cycles.  The default initial  set-
     ting of the "input-period" parameter is 0.


EXAMPLES
     input-period 5
          Input is accepted only every 5th decision cycle by  the
          Soar agent.
