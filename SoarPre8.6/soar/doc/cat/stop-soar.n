_________________________________________________________________

NAME
     stop-soar - Stop Soar

SYNOPSIS
     stop-soar [ -self  [reason-string] ]
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
     Agents may be run using the run command.  The stop-soar com-
     mand  stops  any running Soar agents.  It sets a flag in the
     Soar kernel so that Soar will stop running at a "safe" point
     and return control to the user.  This operates exactly as if
     the user had issued a control-C (SIGINT)  interrupt  to  the
     Soar process.

     -self
          Stop only the soar agent where the command  is  issued.
          All  other agents continue running as previously speci-
          fied.

     _r_e_a_s_o_n-_s_t_r_i_n_g
          An  optional  string  following  -self  which  will  be
          printed  when  Soar  is stopped, to indicate why it was
          stopped.  If left blank, no  message  will  be  printed
          when Soar is stopped.

     This command is usually  not  issued  at  the  command  line
     prompt.   A  more  common  use of this command is as a side-
     effect of pressing a button on a  Graphical  User  Interface
     (GUI),  or  as  a  monitor to be executed at a specific Soar
     Event.  For example, a user may wish to examine  an  agent's
     "matches"  after  the  Soar  Decision Phase.  In order to do
     this in Soar 8, the user must register a monitor,  or  call-
     back,  to issue the "stop-soar -self" command for the event,
     after-decision-phase-cycle.

EXAMPLES
     This example shows how to stop  Soar8  after  this  decision
     phase  using  stop-soar -self in a monitor to stop after the
     decision phase so that memory can be examined.

           monitor -add {stop-soar -self "after decision phase"}         after-decision-phase-cycle


WARNINGS
     If the graphical interface doesn't  periodically  do  a  Tcl
     "update" command, then it may not be possible to interrupt a
     Soar agent from the command line.
