% converted to LaTeX2e by Clare Bates Congdon -- Tue Feb 21 14:45:22 1995
%  * also removing latexinfo stuff; new manual will be in latex and html only
% 
% THIS VERSION:
%  * updates manual to Soar 8
% 
%
% TO PRINT A `FINAL' VERSION OF THIS MANUAL, here's the drill:
%   (not necessarily `final', but to be handed out to folks)
%
% 1. comment out any `includeonly's in this file.
% 2. change 'include' to 'input' for appendices -- may fix TOC problem (see
% 	NOTES below).
% 3. run latex repeatedly and fix source files until you don't get any more
% 	errors. (a few font errors seem to be unavoidable).
%       watch for ``overfull'' messages, which mean that your lines are too
%       long. ``underfull'' can often be ignored.
% 3b. run makeindex
% 3c. edit manual.ind for special characters, such as & 
%	I think the best approach here is probably to put \verb+ + around the
%	special chars.
%	Note that if we put the '\verb+ +' in the index command, the chars
%       might be indexed under \verb...which would maybe be okay, now that I
%       think about it. (should still be alphabetically at the front of the
%       manual.) 
% 3d. run latex yet again
% 4. run dvips and use ghostview to have a peek.
% 5. fix errors.
%     (note that the easiest way to remove all the comments, if that's really
%     what you want to do, is to redefine `comment' and 'betacomment' in this
%     file to be the same as 'nocomment')
% 6. pay particular attention to the toc (table of contents) and the function
% 	summary and index.
%    * the appendices often get screwed up, requiring a hand-edit of the toc
%       file 
%    * the commands in the toc look better if you remove the args to
%       user-interface commands (again, by hand)
%    * if any of the commands in the user-interface has changed, chances are
%    	good that the function summary is no longer current. You can edit
%       manual.glo, as described functions.tex, or just make individual
%       changes.
%    NOTE: there is no point in editing the TOC unless you've got everything
%    else perfect. You have to edit it one run before the last one because
%    latex will overwrite it. (It's sometimes a good idea to save an edited
%    toc if you have to make minor changes that will not change page
%    numbering.)
% 7. If everything looks fine, and you've just re-edited the manual.toc file
%    for the last time, run latex and dvips for the last time.
%
% TIPS ON DEBUGGING LATEX (random problems I'm having as I try to wrap this up)
% * DO NOT edit and save a file (including this one) while you are running
%   latex on said file. Latex seems to have a pointer into the file, and
%   saving can cause huge hunks of text to get skipped or duplicated. And
%   you'll get bizarre errors.
% * If you get an ``undefined reference'' error for a label you know you've
%   defined, the most likely cause is that you've forgotten an \end{verbatim}
%   line in the previous section. The next possibility is that you opened a
ls
%   comment environment and closed it way later than you thought.
% * If the page count seems to suddenly shoot up, its a good bet that you
%   forgot an \end{verbatim} somewhere. If it suddenly drops, you probably
%   forgot to close a comment environment.
%
% OTHER CHANGES MADE IN THIS VERSION OF THE MANUAL:
%  * set odd and even margins differently for twosided printing and binding
%  * created \soar mode, which is just \texttt, but will allow us to change
%    this at whim by editing this file only, rather than search and replaces
%    all over creation.
%  * other playing around with typestyles, trying to get bold typewriter font.
%    I think I've finally found one; sansserif font is redefined to the new
%    typewriter font (probably available only at UofM?), which has italic and
%    bold styles.
%  * created \carat, which puts the ^ character into a non-verbose environment
%    (e.g. soar mode). Might as well note here that you can't easily use
%    verbose mode in the middle of text because it won't add line endings in
%    the appropriate places (you'll just get overfulls). That's why soar mode
%    is needed.
%  * also created \tild for adding tildes in
%  * the function summary and index is now tied to the user-interface chapter.
%    It doesn't have to be in the future, but while the command set is in
%    flux, this seems the best way to keep things consistent. I'm using
%    glossary commands (in the user interface chapter) to write to the
%    manual.glo file, which I then edit into the function summary. See the
%    function summary file for instructions.
%
% NOTES:
%  * to print manual without the .ps files for figures, edit this file only.
%    comment out the definition of \insertfigures and uncomment the other
%    version of \insertfigures, which will just leave whitespace
%  * likewise, all ``comments'' in the text can be removed by redefining the
%    \comment environment to be the same as the \nocomment environment below,
%    rather than searching through all files
%  * to print only some of the chapters, use the \includeonly command; see
%    below 
%  * for final version of manual, have to edit the TOC by hand:
%    1. word ``APPENDIX'' appears the line *after* the listing of the first
%       appendix 
%    2. looks a heck of a lot better if we remove the command arguments from
%       the TOC listing for chapter 6. (This can be done in emacs with a
%       replace-rexexp.) (Replace-regexp ``.\texttt.{.*}}'' with ``}'')

	{\em This is a draft version of the manual; there are lots of little
	changes and a few big changes still to be completed....Some of the
	undone things:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item all indexing needs to be redone
	\item compare index against glossary to see if I left anything out.
	\item change format for user-interface syntax -- use italics to
		specify args that are variable.
	\item have to regenerate a lot of the examples for the user-interface
		chapter. 
	\item the commands in the user-interface chapter may or may not
		correspond to the final release
	\item appendices are still on the sketchy side... getting better \\
		grammars and o-support definitely still need attention
	\item Needs a few more figures
	\item remember to check for consistency, such as upper/lowercase in
		section headings. (and i-support vs. I-support.) Looking over
		TOC and List of Figures would be a good idea.
	\item impasses are resolved; preferences are evaluated -- check for
		consistency 
	\item watch the difference between productions/operators making
		changes to the state and suggesting changes
	\item it would be nice to add a brief troubleshooting guide \\
		for example, to note what happens when someone is running
		``soar'' (rather than ``soartk''), but tries to load Tk code.
	\end{enumerate}


	Fri Jun 20 16:22:27 1997, Major undone things:

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Haven't updated learning chapter
	\item Not sure how much ``advanced'' chapter has changed in the source
		since the last printing (leaving this chapter for next pass)

	\item Haven't incorporated comments from Frank and Aladin
	\item should, perhaps, include them in acknowledgements?

	\item indexing

	\item appendices

	\end{enumerate}

\nocomment{
	Things that I think are done:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Too much of the Tcl stuff got removed (moved into the ``advanced
		manual''). Added ``advanced'' chapter, but haven't written Tcl
		section yet.
	\item blocks-world task has become a big mess -- too many versions
		have been used for different things: \begin{enumerate}
		\item create THE version of the blocks-world to be used with
			this manual (or possibly two versions, one with
			subgoaling?) 
		\item redo figures
		\item include as an appendix
		\item add to distribution
		\end{enumerate}
	\item subgoal stack illustration is from old blocks-world task and
		should be updated
	\item need a brief description of SDE and pointer to docs
	\item also need pointers to tutorial and advanced manual

	\item check double and single quotes -- not always in latex format.
	\item ``evaluate preferences'', not ``resolve'' (impasses are
		resolved; preferences are evaluated). Exception: I left
		``resolved'' for preferences in just a couple of places, to
		mean that the preferences were evaluated and were not
		contradictory. Similarly, they cannot be resolved if they are
		contradictory.
 	\item change 'object' attribute to 'block' in all examples and
		illustrations -- no, change it to `thing'
	\item make sure that command names shown in examples in early chapters
		are consistent with actual command names -- go/run,
		load/source, etc.
	\item operators are not distinguished objects -- the operator
		augmentation of the state is distinguished (not entirely true
		-- operators ARE distinguished, for example, because their
		preferences are not evaluated until the decision phase)
	\item ``everything retracts'', is the impression we give early on and
		then later, we amend this. Not a great idea. From the
		beginning, make it clear that some retract and some don't
	\item use ``substate'' more often, as in ``soar creates a new
		substate''
	\item don't call them databases; call them memories
	\item we've changed the language for talking about preferences, and
	this has not been consistently incorporated. For example, we're trying
	to say that a preference has i-support or o-support, not that a
	production has i-support or o-support. Also a preference may be an
	operator proposal, operator application, operator termination, or
	elaboration, but productions aren't those four types because
	productions can create multiple preferences that fulfill different
	roles.

% Index
%   the file manual.idx is generated by latex; run 'makeindex manual' to
%     create the file manual.ind. However, this has a number of special
%     characters in it which will have to be put in verbose mode to be readable.
%   The characters that have to be changed are mostly at the top of the file;
%     you'll also have to look for all the underscores and change _ to \_ so
%     that latex won't choke.
%   Another option might be to do the whole index in typewriter font, but I
%     haven't tried this yet (maybe for draft versions, at least?). The carat
%     symbol still won't work (replace with \carat), but everything else
%     probably will.
%   In case it isn't obvious, generating the index is one of the last things
%     to do.
